server listens to 8080
if connection- if managed to create tcp conn., create new thread , up to 20
in the thread-
socks connect- wait for connect. if connect is in incorrect format- close the connection
if successful socks connection
tcp connect to the host the client wanted
if host (dest) tcp connection successful- send reply to the client. else err. close conn.

transfer bytes, look for user and password

when i finish sending the reply from the dst to the client, connection terminates

stop all threads at CTRL+C
do we only handle http get to port 80? or more?
what do they want in the bonus?
why do we need 2 threads for connection (src->dst, dst->src)
